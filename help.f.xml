  <text>runio v1.1, 2020-10-07 https://github.com/ruv/wine-runio
Usage: runio [OPTIONS] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS...]
It runs the specified program, and waits when its stdout
is depleted. It's needed as a workaround for some problems in WineHQ
when runing a Linux command-line program with input/output redirection.

Due to a flaw in WineHQ (see bug#18335), a Windows process cannot detect
whether a child Linux process is terminated.
Due to a bug in WineHQ (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/45545068/1300170),
it incorrectly closes the inherited handle when its original is closed.

Options:
  --help, -h          Show this help.
  --no-stdin, -n      Pass nothing to the stdin of the program.
  --verbose, -v       Show all non zero error codes (in stderr).
  --chdir dir         Change the current directory.

NB: if the child program is interactive, and it's terminated, it's needed
to send the EOF signal into runio for termination (^D, Ctrl+D in Linux;
Ctrl+Z in Windows).

Examples:
  runio -n /bin/bash -c "echo test; sleep 1" &amp;&amp; echo the child is finished
  echo echo wating a second; sleep 1; echo finished | runio /bin/bash
